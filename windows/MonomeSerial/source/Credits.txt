Monome Serial XP by Daniel Battaglia
------------------------------------------

Initial Monome Serial OSX application:
- Joe Lake, Brian Crabtree, Daniel Battaglia, Steve Duda, Kevin Nelson

Various free/open-source libraries, toolkits and code used for this Win32 port (these are all great and highly recommended):

- MIDI class library by Leslie Sanford
	- http://www.codeproject.com/audio/midiwrapper.asp
	
- OSC library (oscpack) by Ross Bencina <rossb@audiomulch.com> 
	- http://www.audiomulch.com/~rossb/oscpack
	- this is highly recommended by me for anyone looking for a cross-platform, easy to use Osc Library, that
	  conforms to the same interface as the C++ Standard Library.  
	
- OSC library in MonomeSerial OSX is liblo (by Steve Harris and Nicholas Humfrey).  some ideas and interface are preset in the Win32 version
	- http://liblo.sourceforge.net/

---------------------------------------------------------
MonomeSerial for Windows was created in Visual Studio 2005, using Visual C++ and MFC.  

This code is statically linked to the MFC runtime library.  Only the GUI uses MFC, all code at the ApplicationController level and below are native C++ and Win32.
